Answering real world business questions using Pandas functions and Matplotlib Visualizations

# About the Dataset
The project dataset belongs to a retail organization and has 12 months worth of sales data for the calendar year 2019. The dataset includes thousands of purchases broken down by different attributes such as product, date and time of purchase, store location etc. 

# Business Objective
The company executives would like to identify and understand specific trends with respect to the product purchases. We will be answering 5 high level business questions related to the data:

  1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
  2. What city sold the most product?
  3. What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
  4. What products are most often sold together?
  5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

# Project Related Tasks
To answer the business questions mentioned above, we start by cleaning up our data by performing operations such as:
  1. Identifying and dropping records with NaN values
  2. Identifying and removing duplicate records from the data. 
  3. Correcting column data types(to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)
  4. Augmenting columns to aggregate data and build visualizations 

# Data Exploration 
We will perform exploratory data analysis once the data has been cleaned and prepared for analysis to answer all of the business questions above.
